Stop Volons' Containers
=======================
This program stops containers created with `volons init`.
This program uses the docker-compose command.

Docker and docker-compose have to be installed before running this command.
You should have executed `volons init` to generate a volons-cocker-compose.yml in current directory.
Use `volons init -g` if you want to use global directory and use `volons start -g` from any directory to start containers.

Execute `volons ps [-g]` to print useful information about running containers.
